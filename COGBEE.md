1.immediatly invoked function

An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) in JavaScript is a way to execute a function expression immediately after it's defined. This helps in creating a private scope for variables, preventing them from polluting the global scope. 
Here's the basic syntax:
(function(x, y) {
    // code here
})(arg1, arg2);

2. service workers & Web workers
Web Workers and Service Workers are both features in web development, but they serve different purposes and operate in different contexts.

Web Workers:

1.Web Workers are designed to perform tasks in the background, separate from the main execution thread of a web page.

2.They are used for parallelizing computations and tasks that might be CPU-intensive.

3.Web Workers have no direct access to the DOM (Document Object Model) and cannot manipulate the UI directly.

4.They communicate with the main thread using events and a message-passing system.
5.Web Workers are typically used for tasks like heavy calculations, data processing, or other operations that won't block the main thread.

Service Workers:

1.Service Workers, on the other hand, are a specific type of Web Worker designed for handling network requests, caching, and other service-related tasks.

2.They run in the background and can intercept and manipulate network requests, enabling features like offline support, push notifications, and background synchronization.

3.Service Workers have a lifecycle that is separate from the web page and are often used to improve performance and reliability.
4.They can cache resources to enable offline access, push notifications even when the web page is closed, and perform background sync operations.

In summary, while both Web Workers and Service Workers involve running scripts in the background, Web Workers are more general-purpose for parallelizing computations, while Service Workers are specialized for managing service-related tasks and enhancing the functionality and performance of web applications.
