1.Temporal Dead Zone

The temporal dead zone (TDZ) is a specific period in the execution of JavaScript code where variables declared with let and const exist but cannot be accessed or assigned any value. During this phase, accessing or using the variable will result in a ReferenceError .

2.Hoisting

In JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution. Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local

3.What is closure in JavaScript? 

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

4.Lexical scope 

Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.

5.Async Await

async and await make promises easier to write
async makes a function return a Promise
await makes a function wait for a Promise
