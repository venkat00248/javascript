The temporal dead zone (TDZ) is a specific period in the execution of JavaScript code where variables declared with let and const exist but cannot be accessed or assigned any value. During this phase, accessing or using the variable will result in a ReferenceError .
2.Hoisting
In JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution. Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local
