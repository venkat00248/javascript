In summary:

Use call when you want to immediately invoke a function with a specific context and individual arguments.
Use apply when you want to immediately invoke a function with a specific context and arguments provided as an array.
Use bind when you want to create a new function with a specific context and possibly pre-set arguments, without immediately invoking the original function.
